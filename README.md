# Basic_Node-file-operations
Developed a simple Node.js web server to handle HTTP requests and serve HTML pages with basic file operations.
Used Express to set up routing and handle file operations, allowing users to interact with the file system through the server.
Styled the web page using CSS to create a clean and functional interface for users to perform file operations easily.
